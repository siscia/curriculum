          <p> My philosophy is to always think before to code, most of the time the better solution is also the simplest one. </p>
          <p> On the other side the value of an idea is on the realization, there are too many &quot;Good Ideas but Bad Implementation&quot; </p>
          <p> I have had the pleasure to work on very well tested code, so I am able to value such important thing as UnitTest </p>
          <p> Finally I tried to be involved in OpenSource, it had taught me most of what I know, and also the value of good documentation. </p>

          <p> The last project I worked on:  </p>
          <p> Vaun: http://vaun.bitbucket.org/ html5 app to share picture at your favorite locale, you have fun and the locale get some free ads on facebook. I made it to learn JavaScript, there is no server-side code, only front-end. </p>
          <p> gOrge: http://gorgeapp.appspot.com/ I made this host for markdown document to learn GoLang, it is hosted on Google AppEngine. </p>
          <p> EchoNest clojure API: https://github.com/siscia/echonest-clojure-api an interface to query EchoNest with clojure. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="result methods" id="interest()">
          <p> I am very curios about everything, from math to licterature, but what I love the most is software. </p>
          <p> Since I am so curious, I have some theoric knowledge about pretty much everything on the software field (games, distributed system, AI, apps, database, you name it...); however I still lack the practice I would like on some topic. </p>

      <div class="result methods" id="school()">
          <p> High School: 100/100 -&gt; 4.0 GPA </p>
          <p> College (Politecnico di Milano): Still in progress, not real/definitely vote to show yet. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="result methods" id="is_real()">
          <p> Yes, it is a real, python class, it has some simple meta-programming, you can see the source here: https://gist.github.com/siscia/8512255  </p>
          <p> I didn't want to show a piece of paper where I listed my school achievement, I wanted to show that I can code and that I enjoy it. </p>
          <p> I think outside the box, I solve problems in the easiest and most efficient way, I design solution for the right problem, that's why my resume is different. </p>

      <p> This is the curriculum of Simone Mosciatti, it is a simulation of a Python live session, the method allow are listen below. </p>
      <p> All this is "hand made"", no fancy library but only old plain JavaScript and html </p>
      <p> The python class "MySelf" is a real Python class: you can check that out at <a https://github.com/siscia/curriculum>this repo.</a></p>
      <p> The class is somehow interesting, it use a little bit of meta-programming to decide what methods you should be able to call in this session, it also order such methods, feature not necessary anymore.</p>
      <p> You can call the method either way as they were real method </p>
      <p> Ex: siscia.tool_box() </p>
      <p> Or like they were attribute </p>
      <p> Ex: siscia.tool_box </p>
      <p>>>> siscia = MySelf("Simone Mosciatti", "siscia") </p>
      <p>>>> dir(siscia) </p>
